      quote: 'While working with Rita during her time at General Assembly, I saw her dedication to learning and teaching others. Even though I was an Instructional Associate who helped guide students during the software engineering bootcamp, she often taught me something new as she attempted and succeeded in implementing additional features into her projects. Additionally, whenever she encountered an obstacle, she was never afraid to reach out for help after spending time on her own researching a solution. Rita went above and beyond what was expected of her and challenged herself to learn things outside of the scope of the bootcamp. This led to her gaining a deeper understanding of concepts which will undoubtedly help her in any role she pursues. Any company would be fortunate to have a hard-working and talented individual like Rita who often exceeds expectations while also remaining humble and appreciative of any feedback given. I look forward to seeing where she ends up next on her journey.',
